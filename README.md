**WARNING | DISCLAIMER**

This file is **only** for personal use of the repository owner and for referencing only.

**Sharing or using this repository is not allowed by the repository owner.**
The repository owner does not host or stream any of the content. The links are already accessible freely via internet.

No video files are stored in this repository. The repository simply contains user-submitted links to publicly available video stream URLs, which to the best of our knowledge have been intentionally made publicly by the copyright holders. If any links in these playlists infringe on your rights as a copyright holder, they may be removed by sending a pull request or opening an issue.

However, note that we have no control over the destination of the link, and just removing the link from the playlist will not remove its contents from the web. Note that linking does not directly infringe copyright because no copy is made on the site providing the link, and thus this is not a valid reason to send a DMCA notice to GitHub. To remove this content from the web, you should contact the web host that's actually hosting the content (not GitHub, nor the maintainers of this repository).

No Depository Links on server.
